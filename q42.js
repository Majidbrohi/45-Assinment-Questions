// todo/-- 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// todo/--  Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// todo/--  the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// todo/--  see that the list has actually been modified.
//? First step is to starting from previous quesstion.
var magicians1 = ["Anziq", "Hero Haudni", "David bleni", "Jagga jadogar"];
function showMagicians1(magicians) {
    //? I use forach loop to print each magician name in the array.
    magicians.forEach(function (magicians) { return console.log(magicians); });
}
showMagicians1(magicians1);
//? Second step is to, writing a function (makeGreat).
function makeGreat() {
    magicians1.forEach(function (magicians1) { return console.log("The Great ".concat(magicians1)); });
}
makeGreat();
